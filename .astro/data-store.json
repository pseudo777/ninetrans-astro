If its in a trend, take only with trend trades. If its in a trading range, fade breakouts, i.e., take counter-trend trades.\n\nOf course, many traders find themselves in trouble when they find they are trying to trade with trend but the trend has already ended or they are trying to fade a breakout into a new trend. Therefore, its vital to know when a trend has ended and when a trend is erupting from a trading range.\n\nMany trend terminations are fairly obvious because they end in Wedges or overshoots and then reverse. However, often trends end in a consolidation. The definitive sign a trend has ended is if the trend line is broken. A broken trendline is clear and obvious if the price moves below the previous swing low in a one legged move as it did today from b37 to b40. The fact that it did so after a failed breakout from a horizontal final flag adds credibility to the end of trend. At this point the market is in a trading range bounded by the recent swing high of b37 and the swing low of b40. Any move to the edges of this range may be faded. If the range size is small as it was today, there could be insufficient room to give a scalp profit using price action entries. Limit traders can fade the first approach with confidence knowing that the first attempt is likely to fail and they have a reasonable stop a tick or two above the recent swing points.\n\nTrends usually birth after a breakout failure of one of the bounds of the range. Today, we got two attempts to break above the range at b51 and b65 and this gave a DP (double top/bottom and pullback) at b75. DPs are often trend generators and work best in the direction of the previous trend.\n\nToday's move had a breakout below the range but it failed at a measured move of half the trading range. The failure resulted in a breakout attempt on the opposite side of the range and gave a breakout pullback long entry (essentially a pause bar on b80). A failed breakout on one end of the trading range usually gives a breakout pullback on the other side of the range esp if the test on the second end is a one legged move. These are also very strong trend generators.","src/content/blog/2010-12-31-trend-breaks-and-trend-births.md","9920a56fa15e6cee",{"html":290,"metadata":291},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2010-12-31_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first thing a price action trader learns is that the market is either trending or in a trading range.

Therefore, its vital to know when a trend has ended and when a trend is erupting from a trading range.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Many trend terminations are fairly obvious because they end in Wedges or overshoots and then reverse. However, often trends end in a consolidation. The definitive sign a trend has ended is if the trend line is broken. A broken trendline is clear and obvious if the price moves below the previous swing low in a one legged move as it did today from b37 to b40. The fact that it did so after a failed breakout from a horizontal final flag adds credibility to the end of trend. At this point the market is in a trading range bounded by the recent swing high of b37 and the swing low of b40. Any move to the edges of this range may be faded. If the range size is small as it was today, there could be insufficient room to give a scalp profit using price action entries. Limit traders can fade the first approach with confidence knowing that the first attempt is likely to fail and they have a reasonable stop a tick or two above the recent swing points.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Trends usually birth after a breakout failure of one of the bounds of the range. Today, we got two attempts to break above the range at b51 and b65 and this gave a DP (double top/bottom and pullback) at b75. DPs are often trend generators and work best in the direction of the previous trend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Today’s move had a breakout below the range but it failed at a measured move of half the trading range. The failure resulted in a breakout attempt on the opposite side of the range and gave a breakout pullback long entry (essentially a pause bar on b80). A failed breakout on one end of the trading range usually gives a breakout pullback on the other side of the range esp if the test on the second end is a one legged move. These are also very strong trend generators.\u003C/p>",{"headings":292,"localImagePaths":293,"remoteImagePaths":294,"frontmatter":295,"imagePaths":297},[],[],[],{"title":284,"pubDate":296},["Date","2010-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2010-12-31-trend-breaks-and-trend-births.md","2011-01-04-trend-from-first-bar",{"id":299,"data":301,"body":304,"filePath":305,"digest":306,"rendered":307,"legacyId":316},{"title":302,"pubDate":303},"Trend from first bar",["Date","2011-01-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"![](/images_upscaled/2011-01-04_5m.png)\n\nA great trend bar as the first bar of the day is not to be missed, since it is likely to go quite a long way.

From there, it could transition to any other or have a continuation in the existing direction. Therefore there are nine possible transitions the price could take.\n\nAn up to up after a failed down or horizontal move is a  trend continuation, an up to down is a trend reversal, the flat to up is a breakout and so on. There is a kind of trade you can enter at each transition, if you could spot it in time.\n\nThe complete set would look something like this:\n\n![](/images_upscaled/4T9T.png)\n\nAs you can see, when a trending market flattens out, you need to exit your positions and stay out. Many traders make the mistake of also reversing their positions, but that can only be done when the reversal is clear such as a wedge reversal or a failed breakout of the previous extreme after a trend line break.\n\nThis means there are only four kinds of trades: **Reversals, continuations, breakouts and failed breakouts**. If you can master detecting and trading these transitions, you are already on your way to success.\n\n**Continuations: **Most trending days have two or more continuations. Most continuations are A2, which is a 2 legged pullback to the ema. The simplest way to look at an A2 is the second attempt to end the pullback. As long as any of the bars that make up the pullback are near the ema giving an entry slightly above or below it, you can consider it an A2. Another way to define this is two failed attempts to reverse the trend, i.e. failed L2. Note that if your A2 entry is very far from the ema, you may get a 3rd push which turns into a W pullback to the ema. These should be taken just like they were an A2. In a strong trend, you may have H1s and L1s that work, but new traders should just stick to A2.\n\n**Reversals:** Obvious reversals are rarer on a given day, but the Wedge reversal is likely to be the most successful. The most important requirement of a Wedge reversal is an obvious overshoot (more than 2t) and especially a second overshoot. It takes some experience to correctly read a good Wedge reversal, but the following signs increase the probability of a W reversal:\n\n1. A second overshoot\n2. A strong reversal bar or a up/down bar that has no overlap with previous bars or overlap with the previous swing point\n3. A strong entry bar (shaved or small tailed trend bar)\n4. The entry bar low is not taken out by more than 1t\n5. A one legged move to ema. (A close above the ema may end up giving an A2 long or short instead of W1P)\n\nIf at least three of the above are present, you can take the first higher low for bullish W or first lower high for bear W since that becomes a W1P. If the reversal bar was weak or W entry or W1P signal looks suspicious for example because its a doji or an overlap or large bar, sometimes you get a two legged W1P.\n\nThe following decrease the chances of a successful W1P.\n\n1. Overshoot is small (a tick or two) and there is only a single overshoot\n2. There is an overshoot but it does not look like extreme behavior (W are extreme behaviors)\n3. W signal and entry bars are weak\n\nThe above signs of weakness may imply trend termination into trading range or a pullback and resumption.\n\n**Breakouts and failed Breakouts:** Breakouts from a trading range are complex and are the hardest to read correctly, especially because most breakouts fail. However, there are certain signs of impending breakouts:\n\n1. A double bottom pullback at the bottom of the range generally means the market may breakout at the top of the range. Similarly a DP at the top implies market will breakout at the bottom.\n2. A breakout failure at one end of the trading range may breakout into a trend on the other end of the range, often giving a breakout pullback on the other end.\n3. A W move and breakout to one end of the trading range may give a failed breakout, which in turn  breaks out from the other end of the range.\n\nIn general, its best to trade a breakout pullback after the breakout is successful.  If a breakout does not fail after two or three bars then its more likely to give a breakout pullback.\n\nIf you are a new trader, I suggest concentrating only on A2 till you have mastered it then move to W1P and then to breakouts and failed breakouts.\n\nAn exhaustive description of all the above require their own blog posts and I hope to put them here soon.","src/content/blog/2011-01-17-four-trades-off-nine-transitions.md","4eb08717509dad60",{"html":488,"metadata":489},"\u003Cp>**Update: **A \u003Ca href=\"http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/p/setup-chart.html\">setup chart\u003C/a> is now in its own page.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The market could be moving in only three directions at any time: up, down or flat.

Note that if your A2 entry is very far from the ema, you may get a 3rd push which turns into a W pullback to the ema. These should be taken just like they were an A2. In a strong trend, you may have H1s and L1s that work, but new traders should just stick to A2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Reversals:\u003C/strong> Obvious reversals are rarer on a given day, but the Wedge reversal is likely to be the most successful.

One of the common types of TTRs are found on a hard trend day such as today. Usually, after such a hard move of 10 points or so, the market moves horizontally in a TTR and is essentially a very weak pullback.\n\nThe move from b16 to b35 is a down to horizontal transition and is a TTR. Except the short below b19, every single price action entry failed. This is a very important example of why you need to stay out of a TTR. The only single kind of trade you can take is a breakout after a failed breakout on another side. b28 broke above the previous swing high of b19 and failed giving an A2 short below b36.

Exiting when you detect the TTR is the right approach and here is how I do it. If a hard trend day suddenly produces tiny bars and dojis such as b17 and b18, I will worry a TTR is forming and exit on the next bear bar or near the previous swing low. Then I will wait for a failed breakout and assume we are are breaking out in the opposite direction especially if the failure would break with trend (most TTRs are w/trend flags).

This usually means a hard trend can give a windfall if you swing it yet it can erase all the winnings if it does reverse.

Normally, its best to let them go and wait for a second better signal. Signal bars can be bad for various reasons. First and foremost, they are not the right color. You need a bull bar to buy long and bear bar to short. The second reason is that  the risk is too high because of bar size. The first hour most reversals can work and some traders do trade any reasonable signal.\n\nIn the chart above, is b2 today a first reversal? Since the big bar b1 would act as a trading range, b2 could be breakout and a small pullback could lead to a breakout pullback stopping you out. If it had even a single tick bull body, it would probably be worth the risk.  Similarly b7 could give a breakout pullback since the actual breakout was on bar 6 an additional bar increases the chances of breakout pullback. b9 was indeed a first pullback with an entry above b8 for long or below for short. b12 was just a large doji and not a reversal bar. A second attempt to go below it may be taken as an A2 short.\n\nb25,26 was a down up bar reversal and I missed it along with b27 W1P. Often W1Ps give a channel and its hard to get in until a first channel break as it did on b34. Although b34 was a doji bar and possibly an H1, it was a high probability trade because it was a breakout test of the swing high b21 and also at ema.\n\nThe A2 entry above b50 was questionable because it forced a buy above the flag and one point above the previous entry. If you'd rather not wait for a second entry that usually presents itself as b52 did here, you should use a 8t money stop instead of a price action stop.\n\nW1Ps are usually good for at least a point but sometimes I dont take them. b66 is an example.

A Gap reversal bar after an overshoot of the pullback but demanded a 10t stop. The entry went to a 5t failure and took out the stops below the entry bar. 8t stops were respected however.\n\nIn summary, if the bar is the wrong color, pass up the trade.

Since the bar was a bit large I should have not moved the stop till I had scalped out and this was an error on my part. Avoiding the entry below an outside bar that’s close to the low of day was probably the best thing to do at that point. b16 would also have been a 1st pullback entry if it had occurred a bit higher.

You could scalp part and hold the rest until a breakout or test of the other end of the range.\n\nOccasionally, the market will break a trendline and turn into a TTR as it did at b50.

This is my advice on how to get started. The first step is to trade on SIM only until you unlock the following achievements.\n\n**The rule of ten**\n\n1. At least 10 points every week\n2. For 10 consecutive weeks\n3. With at least 10 days of no losing trades\n4. At least 10 consecutive winning days\n5. Biggest losing day at most half of average winning day (i.e. if your average winning day is +2, your max loss day should be -1)\n\nAll the above proves is that your technique is right. You should now start trading real money. You will probably start to lose money right away. That's ok, because you know that your technique is right and you only need to work on your emotions. If you are entering a lot more trades per day than you would mark on the chart at the end of day, then you have to work on your emotions. Eagerness and impatience are signs of a losing inexperienced trader. Caution and patience are signs of an experienced winning trader. When you feel any urgency to enter a trade mark that on your chart and see how it went at the end of the day.\n\nMy best trades are A2, W1P, DP and fBO. You should start with A2 and stick to A2 only. Why? Because trying to trade W1P may trick you into seeing reversals everywhere. Similarly DP and fBO may trick you into seeing breakouts and failed breakouts everywhere. With A2, there is a very good chance the trend is going to continue.\n\nTrading SIM is like juggling 4 flaming knives while riding a unicycle. Trading real money is the same, except a monkey sitting on your head and messing up your act. So the first thing you do is juggle only one flaming knife. A small one. That's A2. The next thing you do is get off the unicycle and stand on firm ground. That's basically watching only one chart, either the regular trading hours or 24 hour chart and nothing more. There really is not much you can do about the monkey, just hope he gets older and calmer with time.\n\nOnce you consistently make money with A2 and satisfy the rule of 10 with real money, add W1P only to SIM until rule of 10 is unlocked for it. Then you can trade both with real money. Then you can add DP to rule of 10 and finally fBO.\n\nAt this point you should be catching most of the big moves of any day, dont worry about any small moves you have missed. You can't hope to catch every move with high probability.\n\nFinally you can choose to add the following: failed first channel breakout, G2, 1st pullback of the day, first reversal of the day, L1 and H1 on hard trends and expanding triangle.\n\nNote that having a lot of trades in your toolbox is not the important factor. What is much more important is how consistent you are with any given trade.\n\n****\n\n**See Also:**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**[Trading plan: Trading Range day](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2011/08/trading-plan-trading-range-day.html)**\n\n**[Trading plan: Trend days](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2011/08/trading-plan-trend-day.html)**\n\n**[Trading plan: Hard Trends](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2011/07/hard-trend-identification-and-trading.html)**\n\n**[Trading plan: Soft Trends](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2011/03/correctly-trading-soft-trend.html)**\n\n**[Trading plan: Spike and Channel days](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2011/07/spike-and-channel-day.html)**\n\n**\n\n**","src/content/blog/2011-01-29-the-rule-of-ten-a-trading-plan.md","12b4da9ed0022052",{"html":686,"metadata":687},"\u003Cp>You are a rank beginner and you have no idea how to start trading.

If you are entering a lot more trades per day than you would mark on the chart at the end of day, then you have to work on your emotions. Eagerness and impatience are signs of a losing inexperienced trader. Caution and patience are signs of an experienced winning trader. When you feel any urgency to enter a trade mark that on your chart and see how it went at the end of the day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My best trades are A2, W1P, DP and fBO. You should start with A2 and stick to A2 only. Why? Because trying to trade W1P may trick you into seeing reversals everywhere. Similarly DP and fBO may trick you into seeing breakouts and failed breakouts everywhere. With A2, there is a very good chance the trend is going to continue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Trading SIM is like juggling 4 flaming knives while riding a unicycle. Trading real money is the same, except a monkey sitting on your head and messing up your act. So the first thing you do is juggle only one flaming knife. A small one. That’s A2. The next thing you do is get off the unicycle and stand on firm ground. That’s basically watching only one chart, either the regular trading hours or 24 hour chart and nothing more. There really is not much you can do about the monkey, just hope he gets older and calmer with time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once you consistently make money with A2 and satisfy the rule of 10 with real money, add W1P only to SIM until rule of 10 is unlocked for it. Then you can trade both with real money. Then you can add DP to rule of 10 and finally fBO.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At this point you should be catching most of the big moves of any day, dont worry about any small moves you have missed. You can’t hope to catch every move with high probability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally you can choose to add the following: failed first channel breakout, G2, 1st pullback of the day, first reversal of the day, L1 and H1 on hard trends and expanding triangle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Note that having a lot of trades in your toolbox is not the important factor.

And if its a pullback, is it going to be a one legged, two legged or three legged pullback. Or perhaps its a channel down.\n\nFor example in today's chart is b25 a 2 legged pullback or was b19,b24 a double top that we should sell? The answer is simple. In the absence of a trendline break or trend channel line overshoot, always assume the trend is still on and go with trend. The wide overlaps make it difficult to take a price action entry above b25 or 26 or even b30. One option is to buy above the signal bar (b25 or 26 in this case) and allow one pullback below your entry bar. You could also buy part of the position at the expected pullback, i.e., below the twin bars b27,28.\n\nOn the other hand what about b46? Is that a W1P or just a leg up in a two legged move to the ema (eventually at b51). Whenever you ask yourself if this is a W you should ask if this was in any way an extreme move. The move from b31 to b37 was indeed a sharp move and tagged the trendchannel line but did not otherwise exhibit signs of a W reversal.\n\n- There was no obnoxious overshoot.\n- There was no reversal bar\n- The entry bar b38 did not actually trigger theoretical entry below b36.\n\nIt was indeed the third push up and there was a micro trend channel line overshoot, so this could still work like a marginal W1P. Often when the signs are ambiguous you may just get a deep pullback or a trend line break as it did today. Its perfectly alright to take a weaker W1P for a scalp or wait for the next entry.\n\nB56 gave a two legged BP short of the ema. b54 had a lower high and lower close and divided the move into two legs. This is a very strong signal that you should take.\n\nIf for some reason you did buy above b51 assuming its an A2 long, the two legged move to b56 should tell you to exit or reverse.\n\nAlso keep in mind the overall price action context. The horizontal trading range between bars 19-30 could act as a magnet forcing any breakout to be pulled back into the area.\n\nPullbacks are just smaller trends in the opposite direction and an overshoot of its trend channel line or trendline break and test is the best way to determine if the pullback has ended. In general one legged pullbacks should only be taken in very strong trends, 2 legged pullbacks can be taken anytime unless the moves shows strength in the pullback direction (such as breakout bar). 2 or 3 legged (W) pullbacks can be taken if they show an overshoot.

Learning to identify a strong trend and going with it instead of against is very important to your trading success.\n\nOne of the biggest signs of a strong trend day is a large gap. Anything larger than half an average day is a large gap and you should be on the lookout for a strong trend move. Average to small size bars is a good indication this will be a strong trend day. A first pullback (b3,4) instead of a reversal is another indication the price wants to move up. A 1tf of the short entry on b4 is another indication of strength.\n\nAt this point you should be buying any pullback for any reason. A second one tick failure at b9 indicates a very strong day and you can even buy the low of any inside bear bar on limit as long as the bars are reasonable size. You can also buy above any bull inside bar to take an H1 entry. You can continue to do this until there is a strong trend break. However, when the bars get tiny, there is a real chance of a TTR, which simply a trend ending where an up move turns sideways and is part of [the nine transitions](http://cadavertrading.blogspot.com/2011/01/four-trades-off-nine-transitions.html). Buying only above bull bars reduces your chances of buying in the middle of a TTR as does buying after a deeper pullback since TTRs are normally shallow.\n\nWhat about wedges? is b11 a third push up and therefore a wedge? The single most important thing to remember about Wedges are that they will not pullback without an overshoot and they are best tradeable after a trendline break. Therefore, b11 or even b20 should not be expected to give a large pullback. b43 was possibly a W since the move from b20 to b23 could be a marginal trendline break and it did overshoot a tick or so. However its a poor W without an obnoxious overshoot on a very strong day. Even though it did move 3+ points down, it was a harrowing move for nearly two hours. However this move did give a strong break of the trendline and the next W at b77 is more comfortably shortable.\n\nThe most important point to note about trading days like these is that you should have identified a strong trend day decided early in the day to only trade long or just enter after a deep pullback and swing till an obnoxious overshoot or strong trendline break.","src/content/blog/2011-02-01-detecting-and-trading-extremely-strong-trends.md","8f1d6961acc6a8c3",{"html":722,"metadata":723},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2011-02-01_1941.png\" alt=\"\">\nFolks who are used to trading with indicators often destroy their accounts shorting all the way to the top on a very strong trend day.

It may seem that they stop you out to the tick and then reverse the move. Even the reliable A2s can fail as we did today at the A2 off b34. This is because lunch hour bars are badly formed and signals are not good enough for many traders to enter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even fading every breakout is dangerous since breakouts sometime do succeed especially if accompanied by some unexpected news. If the AM session had a trend move, as long as there was no overshoot, you should assume the entire lunch move is likely to be a pullback or trend break at the worst and it should at least test the previous swing extreme.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The correct way to enter the market at the end of the lunch hour is after a trend bar breakout and enter in the direction of its likely failure. Today, the comparatively large trend bar at b48 failed and gave an long entry. which could be held till HOD is tested or end of day with a stop below the entry bar b52\u003C/p>",{"headings":868,"localImagePaths":869,"remoteImagePaths":870,"frontmatter":871,"imagePaths":873},[],[],[],{"title":860,"pubDate":872},["Date","2011-02-10T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2011-02-10-lunch-money.md","2011-02-11-climax-and-exhaustion-bars",{"id":875,"data":877,"body":880,"filePath":881,"digest":882,"rendered":883,"legacyId":892},{"title":878,"pubDate":879},"Climax and exhaustion bars",["Date","2011-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"![](/images_upscaled/2011-02-11_1752.png)\nA climax bar is a large bar on high volume at the end of an extended move.

The most obvious reason is that most continuations succeed and most breakouts fail.  Breakouts can fail multiple times before they eventually succeed as was the case today.\n\nBefore you can read breakouts, you need to be able to detect when a trend has terminated into a trading range. The simplest and the easiest way is to look at the two recent highs and lows. If they are sideways, the trend has ended. Trends terminations (TT) usually have weak reversal signals that not many will take such as the poor oio reversal at b35-37 and give a weak continuation signal such as the bull bar A2 short at b44 that very few took. Trends can also terminate into TTRs or by eventually breaking a trendline. Although the trendline broke at b66, the trader should already expect a trend termination at the poor oio at b37 and confirmation by the weak A2 at b44 and the two legged failed breakout at b57.\n\nThe expanding triangle (XT) breakout is comparatively the easiest to detect and trade. An expanding triangle is simply a series of fBOs, each enlarging the range after trend failure. The trading range after trend termination begins with the reversal or climax pattern itself (b35 high to b37 low) and every move is just an attempt to expand the range. Once both ends of this pattern are taken out, you can take trades and expect them to move to the other end until you get both a HH and HL for a bull breakout or LH and LL for bear breakout into trend. Note that the breakout could be either up or down regardless of the direction of the previous trend. The HL or LH will usually be a two legged move and today the doji bar b70 separated the two legs down.\n\nThis point is the first pullback in the new trend and is the best swing entry for the rest of the trend.","src/content/blog/2011-03-04-trend-terminations-and-breakouts.md","64305fd773c71da9",{"html":1082,"metadata":1083},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2011-03-04_1804.png\" alt=\"\">\nToday’s post addresses the second row of the \u003Ca href=\"http://cadavertrading.blogspot.com/2011/01/four-trades-off-nine-transitions.html\">nine transitions\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The easiest type of pattern to read in real time is a continuation and the hardest type of pattern to read is the breakout and for a variety of reasons.

A poor reversal signal b45 followed by a poor continuation signal at b51 is a sign of trend termination and one should be looking for breakouts into new trends at this point.\n\nBut until a trend terminates, oio failures are possibly your best bet to get into a hard trend move since they present such few opportunities to get in late if you missed the 1PB entries at b7 or b13.","src/content/blog/2011-03-07-oio-reversals-and-failures.md","bc9388e567708700",{"html":1100,"metadata":1101},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2011-03-07_2006.png\" alt=\"\">\nI’ve often spoken about how outside bars are trading ranges and are often fade candidates.

The PM trend\n\nThis breakdown is a guide and not iron-clad law. Some days may look like lunch the entire day and we call those small range days. Some days will start with the first reversal and the AM trend may continue into the close. We call these trend from 1st bar days. You need to adapt your expectations to the price action you see early in the day. For example, a day with large counter-trend bars in the early trend may give a stronger breakout attempt from the lunch consolidation, while weak or no counter trend bars may result a shallower attempt.\nHow do you trade these? In general, if the first bar is a trend or reversal bar and has a strong close and is beyond the range of the previous day, you could trade its breakout, especially if its trying to close the gap. Often this is the best entry on such days. On most days however, its best to let the opening rage define itself and either fail its breakout or enter on its breakout pullback.

This allows you to exit your positions precisely and perhaps ride the reversal as well.\n\nThere are a few things to look for in a major reversal. The first is that the trendline break needs to be a strong break. This means the break is for several bars and several points. In general you want half the move on each side of the trendline. A slight break such as the dip of b11 below the trendline from b1 to b6 may not necessarily break the trend.\n\nThe second thing to look for is a failure to move much beyond the extreme before the trend break (b16 high). When you see a strong push at this point, its a great place to exit on strength. If the price is able to move many bars and many points beyond it, the trend should be expected to continue until another trendline break.\n\nThe last item to look for is a reversal signal just beyond the prior extreme. Today we got a 2 bar reversal at b40,41. A reversal bar or a weak bar followed by a small inside trend bar are also perfectly acceptable. If there is no reversal signal, its best to wait for a second entry or let the reversal proceed and enter on the first pullback.\n\nOften the first pullback after a reversal is very shallow (b46), but will run for many points.

While the key to trading is to take the best setups, limit trading on small bar days can improve your win per trade by 4t or more. On large bar days this approach may not be very fruitful, simply because the momentum of every move can easily trigger tight stops. In general, I dont look for limit entries except when there is overlap since overlapped entries tend to give deep pullbacks. Limit entries are primarily a means to enter late, often at a better price.\n\n***1st Channel breakouts:*** When the momentum is strong and no bar has dipped below the low of the prior bar, the first bear **trend** bar close (b4) can be bought on limit with a stop below a recent trend bar (b2). If the stop is too far away, do not take the trade.\n\n***Entry bar tests: ***When an inside signal bar (b13, mDP) triggers, the entry bar's high will often be taken out by 1t (b14, b39). This provides a very tight entry at the high of the entry bar. The stop can be as tight as 3t, but if a trend bar is nearby, you could place the stop beyond it (b12 high, b38 high).\n\n***Breakout tests:*** When the highest low of the day or the lowest high of the day are approached for the first time, there is a good chance it will fail from 0-2t away. A BT entry can be placed 3t away from the breakout point with a stop 4t above. For example, b37 high would have been a breakout test of b11 low if it was the first approach. In general, BT is for breakouts and should not be expected to work unless a trend move did break from that point.\n\n***Double bottoms:*** A double bottom off strong bar can be expected to bounce at least as much as the size of the bar. For example, b45 low made a double bottom with b33 and is a possible limit entry. The stop would be below a recent trend bar (not-existent in this chart, so its not a real entry). The trick to taking double bottoms is to always take them on the 2nd or 3d push. For example, although b37 low did give 4t, you really want to buy on the second leg down at b45.","src/content/blog/2011-07-19-limit-entries.md","c2305198452b55ba",{"html":2788,"metadata":2789},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2011-07-19_1411.png\" alt=\"\">\nAfter experimenting with limit entries, I have narrowed down a few prospective entries that work somewhat consistently and when they do work, they give a slightly better entry than a preceding or subsequent stop entry.

On many days this means missing a large portion of the AM move but a 2L pb is far easier to enter.\n\nThe main thing to watch out for in a 2 legged pullback is the quality of the signal bar. Often the first signal bar is a trap. For example b24 was an outside bar and b33 was a doji. b47 had a tail on the entry side, was away from the ema and was strongly overlapped by prior bars. In such cases, you should simply wait for the next signal. You will know your entry is correct when your signal bar is strong (b37) and after it closes, the breakeven stop at your entry price will not be hit.\n\nYou should always be on the watch for possible trend terminations such as a double top, W (b75), TTR or a trendline break. After this point, there may be no more A2s.\n\nOnce you can trade trend days adding trading range days is easier.

Identifying a trading range day is a lot easier: If its not a trend day, it's very likely to be a trading range day. Rather than go with the default, I use a simpler heuristic. After the first two up and down moves (including any gaps), if you are back where you started from, its likely to be a trading range day. For example, today the first move up was the gap and the bull trend bar b1 and the second move down was b8. At this point, you are back where you started, so this is likely to be a trading range day with b1-b8 as the opening range.\n\n![](/images_upscaled/2011-08-12_3m.png)   On a trading range day, the first few bars are likely to have a lot of overlaps and tails, preventing a clear signal bar. One way around this is to trade a smaller timeframe such as the 3m chart as shown here. The entries are mid-bar on the 5m chart and do not really make much sense but are much clearer on the 3m chart. Once the first hour or so is complete, you should no longer look at the 3m chart since the setups there are likely to be of lower probability of success.\n\nTrading range days often have two legged moves in each direction followed by two legged moves in another without really moving too far from the range. Most swing entries are likely to fail and your breakeven stop is likely to be hit. So a valid plan is to take every two legged move and exit on the second push. For example, if you sold 3m b2 on the chart shown to the left, you would exit when the second push ended either on strength at the close of 3m b9 or when a bar ticks beyond a prior bar (above 3m b14).\n\nHowever, I avoid trading this way, simply because I prefer larger moves. A viable plan is to buy near the low of the range and sell near the high of the range. Simply stated, trade the failed breakouts of the range and try to hold it till the other end of the range is tested. So for example, the 5m b32 gave a failed breakout of the HOD b1. The right approach is to short this and try to hold it till b9 low is tested.\n\nTo constrain yourself to truly taking trades only near the ends of the trading range, divide the opening range into three parts and mark out the central part. Take only buy signals below it and sell signals above it. Hold it till the price crosses to the other side (b27) or attempts to bounce back a second time (b50). Ignore all entries that would take place in the center. This should allow you to swing even on a trading range day and avoid most of the choppy entries. When a new lod or hod (b30) extends the range, adjust your box accordingly.\n\nUsing this system, you would have only taken the long above b17 and the shorts below b32 and b56. These also happen to be the best swingable trades today. Note that this may not work on TTR days, when the range of the day is 5 points or less. TTR days are best not traded at all, since any trade is low probability.\n\nJust as you stop trading trends when the trend terminates into a trading range, you need to stop trading a range when it breaks into a trend.

Essentially, they are at 50% with a 5 to 10% trend skew. This means that the more trades you take, the higher your chances of losing money and the more your broker loves you.\n\nHolding for larger swings forces you to take fewer trades and make more points per trade. This also forces you to take quality trades and focus on the bigger picture, rather than be lost in the details of the most recent bar.\n\nMost days are like the chart above. There is a trend attempt early in the AM and then a trading range. Trading the 20% of the days when the move is continually in the same direction is important, but that is easier since you do get multiple continuation entries.\n\nOn a typical day like today however, its very important to get in the AM trend and ride it till it terminates or reverses. If you missed b1 today, there was no real reasonable with trend setup until possibly b25. On the other hand, the market did give three counter-trend setups at b9, b30 and b38.

Signal bar selection is very important if you wish to use stop entries to enter on the breakout of signal bars. Almost all failures for stop entries have a few common characteristics and mastering them will reduce your error rate.\n\n1. Overlaps: Overlaps, especially large bar overlaps are the easiest risk to recognize and evaluate. In general large bars are poor signal bars regardless of overlap. Any overlap practically guarantees the trading range attribute of the signal bars and you should wait for a small bar at one end of the overlap (b16, b26) and take the fBO of the overlap. Overlaps of small bars such as b47-51 are usually ok to take a second attempt with-trend. These should never be taken in a trading range (expecting a breakout for example) and never the first attempt.\n\n2. Dojis before reversal bars: Dojis represent a trading range and a reversal bar after the doji does not invalidate this fact (b21-22). A second attempt, especially after trapping traders in both directions (b35) may be an OK entry to take even with dojis.\n\n3. First attempts: Its clear from the charts that first attempts (b22, b33, b60) are highly likely to fail compared to second attempts. First attempts should be reserved for very clear and very specific cases such as 1Rev (b3), W reversals (b72) and 1PB or at the very least only for excellent signal bars.\n\n4. Poor signal bars: Poor signal bars (b11, b60) almost certainly will give a pullback simply because some traders will fade its breakout. This is why a second attempt is recommended if the signal bar is the wrong color, has a long entry-side tail or is a doji. Even if the first attempt succeeds, there is usually a pullback before the market moves too far from the entry off a poor bar.\n\nIf you consider bars that had minimal pullback, i.e., went a large distance before a pullback and hence are swing candidates(b7,64,72), they usually are well-formed bars with a strong close or are second attempts (b16, 35).

The reason is very simple. Market inertia dictates that when in a trend, the market is likely to continue in the trend and the with-trend entry is a high probability setup. A fBO on the other hand could turn into a BP or fail on the first or second attempts and work only on the third attempt (as a mini-W).\n\nThis is why unless the range is large, you shouldn't even bother taking fBO trades. With that caveat, we can still attempt to deduce the best and worst fBO setups.\n\nThe first fBO setup is b2, the failure of the breakout of the large bar b1, which acts as a small TR. Since the entry would be in the lower half of the range, it is likely to fail, esp. since its a first entry. If the entry was very close to the high of b1, this would be worth the risk reward only because the bar is large. If the bar were 4 points or smaller, its best to ignore the fBO of b1.\n\nThe second fBO is b6, an attempt to reverse the close of prior day and three pushes up (b2,4,6). This is a higher probability trade and can be labeled OR.\n\nThe next possible fBO/BP was b16, which was a strong BO and did not give a decent BP signal bar. At this point, we have a higher high and a higher low and we are in a possible bull trend and should not look to trade fBOs. Rather we should look for 2L PB to ema or TL and take with-trend trades or watch for a trend break. This means we would ignore b21 and even b24 if it was well-formed.\n\nThe one-legged move to and close below ema at b29 possibly broke the trend, so we should again switch to looking for fBO and BP. The three push to b45 is an OK setup, but normally, I avoid taking mid-range entries when the market is not in a trend. If we had been in a trend or the move to b23 was a strong trend, I would consider buying b47 as a possible G2.\n\nThe fBO at b55 is the most desirable kind of fBO. The bar that broke above the HOD turned into a reversal bar with out overlaps of any other bar. (A doji is an acceptable fBO signal at extremes of the day). A reversal bar or inside bar after the BO bar would also be excellent signals.\n\nTo summarize, good fBOs are three pushes beyond the trading range or failures immediately after the breakout when you are certain you are not in a trend.","src/content/blog/2011-09-23-good-and-bad-fbo.md","29ca9c673673685a",{"html":3578,"metadata":3579},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2011-09-23_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve often mentioned that trading with-trend in a trend is the easiest way to trade and fBO are some of the hardest trades to take.

A successful breakout leads to a trend. Similarly, a successful failure to resume the trend leads to a trading range. Today, b15 and b28 were failures to resume the trend and b67 was a successful resumption of the trend.\n\nAfter every breakout, the trader needs to decide if he will fade the breakout or enter with the breakout on a pullback. In general, when in a trading range, a trade on the failure of the breakout is more likely to succeed and certain important signs are needed to trade with the breakout.\n\nThe signs are:\n\n1. Breakout is strong (i.e., half or more of the breakout bar is beyond the break point)\n2. Strong close\n3. Second attempt to breakout\n4. Poor attempt to fail the breakout\n\nLets look at these one by one:\n\n1. **Strong breakout:** b27 and b67 were both very strong breakout bars, but b67 was more than halfway above the break point. Even though b27 was less than halfway out, there was a good chance that a 2 or 3 legged pullback could give a second attempt up. On the other hand b10 was a weak breakout with weak close.\n2. **Strong close: **A strong close beyond the breakout point indicates that there were insufficient fade orders at the break point. A weak close followed by a deep pullback (such as b29-46) indicates possible failure of the breakout. A weak close such as b10 indicates fade orders were waiting and a failed second attempt (b15) is likely to seek the other end of the range.\n3. **Second attempt:** Second attempts are stronger than first attempts and second attempts of strong closes usually are very successful. An fBO (b28) that fails to take out the other end of the range (b15 low) should be treated like a deep pullback and is a possible trend break (HL after HH). This is especially true after a fL2 such as the one at b50.\n4. **Poor attempt to fail the breakout: **b11 and b15 are strong attempts to fail the breakout. Usually, when the first failure is pronounced (b11,12), the second will usually go much further (b15-b27). If the bar after the breakout bar is a reversal or inside bar with a strong close such as b28, there is a high probability of at least 2 legs down, possibly deep. If the attempt to fail the breakout is poor such as b67, and it does not trigger, the chances are very high that the price will seek a measured move of the prior range (b28-45 met at b79).","src/content/blog/2011-09-26-price-action-basics-iv-trading-ranges-trends-fbos-.md","1abe02f5271bd724",{"html":3596,"metadata":3597},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2011-09-26_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A breakout from a trading range is an attempt to create a trend and its failure is a move back into the trading range.

ES traders often have one point as their scalp size, forex traders have 10 pips and so on. Technically, the smallest possible scalp is 1 tick in futures and 0.01 in stocks. In general a scalp is around the same size as the risk (distance from entry to stop). Traders who enter on stops above signal bars need to adjust their trading to resize their scalp size with changes in signal bar size.\n\nA swing is a large undetermined move many times the size of the original risk. Swing entries are essential to be a profitable trader since scalp entries are likely to be breakeven at best for the new trader.\n\nNot all entries are swingable. To be swingable, you should have a reasonable expectation that the next pullback will not take out your breakeven stop. For example, today b23 or even b26 was not a swing setup, only b30 was. Only trend continuation setups (i.e., setups that are likely to continue the trend to a new extreme are swingable. The best swingable setups are: 1PB, A2, W1P. BPs and fBOs in particular are not usually swingable.\n\nUsually, second attempts, failures (such as the 1tf on b30), the first pullback in a new trend are swingable.

You can basically take every reasonable with-trend entry and chances of success are high unless you are near the end of the trend. On a trading range day, things become much more uncertain and swing entries will be stopped out all the time.\n\nA simple heuristic to deal with trading range days is to buy below overlaps and sell above them. For our purposes, an overlap is any trading range bar such as the outside bar b7, any bars that overlap such as b54,55 or any horizontal range such as b69-72.

The skill level of market reading necessary to be able to consistently win at limit entries is very high and I am not too proud to admit that I'm not there yet.

After all, there is the promise of easy money or rather, lots of easy money that we can gain by trading. Greed may be good, but it will force the trader to make many mistakes.\n\nOne of the worst mistakes a trader can make is entering on a poor setup because \"this could take off from here\". You are afraid to be left out. This brings us to our first realization: ***Greed is just fear thats not immediate***.\n\nHowever, when you do get in on the poor setup, either because the signal bar was poor or because the pullback was too shallow or any other reason, you probably entered at a poor price point and a possible pullback will take out your stop unless you use a wide stop. From this we infer: ***Greed forces us to enter on a large risk***\n\nOften, even a large stop could be hit and you may resort to loosening your stop, which of course can still be hit so you end up taking a stop much larger than your profit expectation. A stop placement on entry is a statement that if the entry is correct, the price should never touch the stop. If you loosen stops habitually, you are not really trading with stops. Therefore, ***Greed forces us to disregard our stops***\n\nSome traders when faced with a wide stop will add on at the worse price so that they have a better chance of breaking even and a tighter net stop. This means that ***Greed forces us to throw good money after bad***.\n\nIdeally, you want to be very choosy about where you enter and understand that success lies in consistency (steady, higher percentage of wins) rather than depending on any one trade \"taking off\". The key to this is to take strong bars on deep pullbacks or at the ends of a trading range. However, if you do enter on a poor bar and it does not take off, remember that ***the first loss is the best loss***. Take your loss and wait for the next setup. Refusing to accept being wrong and replaying the losing scenarios described above is the quickest way to a blown account.\n\n\"Be fearful when others are greedy\" is a simplification. Fear is equally unproductive. The correct antidote to greed is caution. When you feel an urgency to enter, do not enter unless the signal is good and risk is acceptable.  Do not fret about letting a big mover pass you by. There is always another trade with a better signal in the very near future. Once you enter, let the trade fail if it needs to.

Fear is equally unproductive. The correct antidote to greed is caution. When you feel an urgency to enter, do not enter unless the signal is good and risk is acceptable.  Do not fret about letting a big mover pass you by. There is always another trade with a better signal in the very near future. Once you enter, let the trade fail if it needs to.

In particular, they give good swing entries that tend to go to 4 points or more.\n\nThe first requirement is that there is a trend. A trend should be fairly easy to spot. If the chart in front of you is moving from bottom-left to top-right or top-left to bottom-right, you are likely to be in a trend. The conventional definition is higher highs and higher lows for a bull trend and lower lows and lower highs for a bear trend.\n\nThe second requirement is a strong signal bar. A weak signal bar in a shallow pullback and overlap will work in a soft trend such as the earlier part of today (b23,33,41). However, once the trend is no longer soft, every such signal bar is likely to fail (b57,61,65).\n\nThe third requirement is no overlap, because overlaps are trading ranges and their breakouts are likely to be faded. However, if the signal bars are strong and at support, you can take some second entries since they can act like breakout pullbacks. If you are unsure, avoid overlaps.\n\nThe last requirement is a deep pullback. A deep pullback ensures there is sufficient room to the previous extreme to allow a profitable exit. For most trades, that equates to about 10ticks for a 2 point profit. However, as long as the pullback is deeper than a recent bar (b69) its likely to succeed with-trend.\n\nSoft trends and hard trends are special in that they dont give deep pullbacks or good signal bars but nearly every signal works.

Depending on where you are in the trend, you have a few options. For example, let us suppose you determined that the W move and FF to b12 ended the bear move and is setting up a reversal of the opening trend. If you did not buy b12, you could always enter on the very first pullback. b15 high was lower than b14 on the March contract and you could have bought above it. i.e, Shallow, 1 legged pullbacks are acceptable right after the trend begins.\n\nOften you can also buy the first 2 legged pullback. For example, b28 was the first 2 legged pullback and in this particular case, there is always the risk that the breakout above b1 would fail and give a deeper pullback or reverse the move up but in many other cases, the first 2 legged pullback of a strong move often works even if its not deep. Normally, I will not trade a pullback that's not deep even if its the first 2 legged pullback. Exceptions are when its a soft-trend day, when the pullback is at ema and the signal bar is strong. b28 presented none of those conditions.\n\nBut what you definitely can buy is the first deep pullback. All shallow pullbacks (b15,18,28,30,35,39) can be considered part of the same larger leg and the first deep pullback should usually gives at least one more leg in the same direction.\n\nA deep pullback is one where the pullback is at least 2 points from the extreme of the day and deeper than the size of at least one recent bar. Breakouts of deep pullbacks, (especially the first) are stronger and fill your targets quicker with a smaller risk of pullback to your entry price. This makes them excellent swing entries. If the breakout from a deep pullback goes much beyond the previous extreme, the chances of the trend terminating on a test of the prior extreme diminish and you can take the next deep pullback with higher confidence.","src/content/blog/2012-03-08-preferring-deep-pullbacks.md","53d85c9641381766",{"html":5197,"metadata":5198},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2012-03-08_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most important skill to master trading with trend is selection of the appropriate pullback to enter on.

If you did not buy b12, you could always enter on the very first pullback. b15 high was lower than b14 on the March contract and you could have bought above it. i.e, Shallow, 1 legged pullbacks are acceptable right after the trend begins.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Often you can also buy the first 2 legged pullback. For example, b28 was the first 2 legged pullback and in this particular case, there is always the risk that the breakout above b1 would fail and give a deeper pullback or reverse the move up but in many other cases, the first 2 legged pullback of a strong move often works even if its not deep. Normally, I will not trade a pullback that’s not deep even if its the first 2 legged pullback. Exceptions are when its a soft-trend day, when the pullback is at ema and the signal bar is strong. b28 presented none of those conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But what you definitely can buy is the first deep pullback. All shallow pullbacks (b15,18,28,30,35,39) can be considered part of the same larger leg and the first deep pullback should usually gives at least one more leg in the same direction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A deep pullback is one where the pullback is at least 2 points from the extreme of the day and deeper than the size of at least one recent bar. Breakouts of deep pullbacks, (especially the first) are stronger and fill your targets quicker with a smaller risk of pullback to your entry price. This makes them excellent swing entries. If the breakout from a deep pullback goes much beyond the previous extreme, the chances of the trend terminating on a test of the prior extreme diminish and you can take the next deep pullback with higher confidence.\u003C/p>",{"headings":5199,"localImagePaths":5200,"remoteImagePaths":5201,"frontmatter":5202,"imagePaths":5204},[],[],[],{"title":5191,"pubDate":5203},["Date","2012-03-08T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2012-03-08-preferring-deep-pullbacks.md","2012-03-09-anticipating-dp-setups",{"id":5206,"data":5208,"body":5211,"filePath":5212,"digest":5213,"rendered":5214,"legacyId":5223},{"title":5209,"pubDate":5210},"Anticipating DP setups",["Date","2012-03-09T00:00:00.000Z"],"![](/images_upscaled/2012-03-09_5m.png)\n\nA prolonged horizontal move breaks a trend, but you dont need to wait that long to detect a trend termination. Any poor reversal (b66) followed by a poor A2 (b71) is sufficient criteria. Any cluster of dojis after a pullback starts (b15-b23) is usually also sufficient to declare a trend termination.\n\nAt this point, you are in a trading range and no longer in a trend. Any A2 or other continuation trade is likely to result in failure. Even if you missed reading the termination, entering only on strong signal bars would protect you from poor setups.

The next thing you do is to step back from your computer, perhaps get a glass of water to drink or do a couple of push-ups. This is analogous to walking away after being hit instead of risking life and limb in a fight.

However, a strong bear close that overshoots a bull channel TCL from the prior day is a sign of a move down. If a trader chooses to sell below b1 instead of waiting for a breakout pullback of b1, he may follow standard price action principles and move his stop above b2.

After all, the setup is just too beautiful. How could it ever fail?\n\nThe failure of a beautiful setup usually means you are still in a choppy trading range and there is a very good chance that any setups near this area are likely to fail regardless of direction.

For example, if an experienced trader shorted below b71 after reading it as an A2 short (since b69 is an L1 variant) and was stopped out, he may retain the clarity of mind to correctly short b74 as a W pullback. (but he could probably never do so if he reversed and went long during b73.)\n\nHowever, under most circumstances its best to wait out two swings. A short below b50 DT was stopped out at b55.  Naturally, a short after 7 bull bars is likely to fail even if this was not  BW.

The price has also moved the size of a recent bar or two away from the original price and has also given the trader some time to regain composure.\n\nIn summary, when you encounter a loss, always avoid getting back in right away.

If a failure does not give you any information, you should avoid trading it. Most of my setups give certain definite information about market structure when they fail.\n\nFor example, b9 today was a possible 1PB setup. Its a poor bar, being essentially a red bar, the pattern is a 1 legged deep pullback and the location is a double bottom with a strong trend bar.

Directional error: Trader in incorrect regarding primary market direction\n2. Entry error: Trader has entered too early or on the wrong bar\n3. Stop error: Trader has used stop thats too wide or too narrow\n4. Execution error: Trader loosened or tightened stop too early or was shaken out.\n\n**Directional error:** A trader has missed the end of a trend or incorrectly reads a pullback as a reversal. Misreading a trading range as a trend and vice-versa also are part of directional error. A couple of years of trading later, traders get a general sense of where the market is heading and these errors should become rarer. For example, the move to b68 broke the trend and its clear even without a trendline. At this point any with-trend setup such as b69 should be suspect. b69 buy is a directional error.\n\n**Entry error:** The trader is generally right regarding where the market is headed but enters on improper bars. For example, after two failures to sell in the AM (b3 and b8), there is a good chance the market is headed higher. A trader who buys b12 makes an entry error.\n\n**Stop error:** The trader is right regarding direction and entry. However, his stop is to tight or too lax. A trader who bought b28 with a 5t stop had a very tight stop and would be stopped out. Overlaps require a larger stop, at least 6t. Inside bars have their theoretical stops below the preceding outside bar. Similarly, a buyer above b6 who keeps his stop below b6 has a stop that's too large.\n\n**Execution Error:** Entering late (more than 1t beyond bar except due to slippage), getting shaken out on the first pullback (ok to exit on the second pullback), tightening stop before price moves away or gives a first pullback, loosening stop so that the pullback does not hit your stop, exiting when you have a tiny profit are some of the common execution errors. Most execution errors are due to psychological pressure and it often means the risk is too much for you to bear. \n\nA trader often grows by overcoming these errors often in the exact order above. If your sense of direction is generally wrong, you will never be able to swing for many points. You should think of alternative trading styles, such as scalping for a point or two and trying to reach a high level of accuracy. Entry errors are usually caused by taking the first setup, usually a poor setup due to large signal bar or overlap.

Misreading a trading range as a trend and vice-versa also are part of directional error. A couple of years of trading later, traders get a general sense of where the market is heading and these errors should become rarer. For example, the move to b68 broke the trend and its clear even without a trendline. At this point any with-trend setup such as b69 should be suspect. b69 buy is a directional error.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Entry error:\u003C/strong> The trader is generally right regarding where the market is headed but enters on improper bars.

A trader who bought b28 with a 5t stop had a very tight stop and would be stopped out. Overlaps require a larger stop, at least 6t. Inside bars have their theoretical stops below the preceding outside bar.

Many traders fall into this trap because they only pay attention to bars and have no choice but to flip on anything that may look like a reversal bar.  For example, if a trader shorted b29 as two legs up in a bear and then on b32 he may interpret that the trend may have flipped and buys b32 and then sells b34 and so on.\n\nThe second reason traders fall for this is that have heard that a failure is a strong signal and a failed failure is an even stronger signal and two failures in the same direction are extremely strong etc. Therefore if a trader sold b34 as a W24,29,34 he may see b37 as two pushes down and reverse to long. The chop in this area may end up being read as fL2 or fH2 or any number of things causing him to interpret a new direction with every bar.\n\nThe real problem here is that the trader is focusing on a micro level. A trader always needs to keep in mind if the market is trending (b1-b17) or chopping around (b25-b45), breaking out and failing (b46-53) or breaking out and continuing (b56-70). **Being aware of the nine transitions reduces directional error.**\n\nReversing very often is rooted in the fear of missing an impending very large move. This symptom also suggests that a trader's sense of market direction is undeveloped. This can be combated by realizing that if you are stopped out twice near the same price area, you are probably in chop and your entry is effectively trying to predict a breakout. Predicting breakouts is one of the hardest things to do in trading, whereas waiting for a breakout to occur and jumping on the first pullback is far easier.\n\nMy way of avoiding falling into this trap is to assume that if my trade fails, the market probably in a chop and except in the first hour, I will avoid re-entering until the price moves away from the area. For example, if I read b34 as a W and sold it, I will not trade until price moves away from b34, i.e. until b49.\n\nThere are two exceptions to this rule. If an opposing trade fails twice, I may consider entering again in the same direction. For example, I was stopped out of my trade on b17 long, b20 setup a short and failed twice when b25 triggered. This should only be done if you are expecting a very large move.\n\nIn the first hour if the stop out was due to a fixed stop and not a theoretical stop, I will usually re-enter. For example, if I shorted b1 and my 6t stop was taken out, then the trade hasn't theoretically failed until b2 high is taken out. I will enter on b6 even though the price hasn't moved away from my losing trade.\n\nRemember that there are one or two and occasionally three good swings a day.

If b1 is 2 points then the daily range could be expected to be around 10 points. Therefore you can simply exit when the range comes close to the expected boundary. For example, today's b1 was 2.25 points.

In general, there are three kinds of channels and they are traded similarly from a higher level view but the specifics are different.\n\n**Trading Range Channel (TRC): **A TRC is a shallow sloped wide-range (3+ points between swings) channel made of large bars (2+ points). The move from the open to about b31 today is a classic TRC. For most traders, TRCs are the most dangerous form of price action. This is because they always appear to be just about to reverse and most of these attempts fail. A new trader may be trapped trying to trade today's AM several times: fBO b5, 2L reversal b9, HL after strong reversal b14, W b19. Note that most of these bars were fairly decent and patterns looked clear. a TRC will trick and frustrate traders over and over. These are dangerous to trade because the stops required are large.\n\n**Leg ****Channel ****(LC):** A leg channel has a slightly steeper slope and usually smaller bars. Most bars are however overlapped and there are many bars with tails. The move from b47-59 is a good example. These are fairly easier to trade since the stops required are smaller. You can enter after any pullback or small bar as long as its near the channel trendline. For example, b50, b55 but not b52 since it was away from the trendline. A small poke beyond a prior bar sets up a 1st channel breakout setup (1CBO). The first BO against the channel is a high probability failure so you should take a trade in the direction of its expected failure. You can also fade the close of the first opposing trend bar (b54).\n\n**Trend Channel (TC):** A trend channel is actually a regular trend move with very small bars. They appear to overlap but each bar dips only a tick or two below the prior bar implying traders entering aggressively on the close of the prior bar. b59-b64 is a very good example. These can be traded like any strong trend. Enter on the first pullback (b63) or the first opposing strong close (b67) or the first tail in the direction of the move (for example if b64 had a 1t bull body).\n\nChannels types are all related to each other. A TRC is a LC on a higher timeframe, which is a TC on a higher timeframe. TCs in turn are regular trends (such as b65-73) on a yet higher timeframe. Therefore trend strength from weakest to strongest is TRC->LC->TC->Trend.\n\nAs you see the price action change from one type to another, it may be an advance notice that a trend is likely to breakout as today or when it moves in the opposite sequence, it may indicate that the trend is about to terminate into a trading range.","src/content/blog/2012-07-06-channel-types.md","6568bf462d8c2131",{"html":6079,"metadata":6080},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2012-07-06_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Channels occur very often and trading them profitably is presently an area of research.

The obviously important turns and their pullbacks today were  b8(4t), b23(2t), b40(0t) and b59(1t). If you notice, they pulled back very little after they triggered. For swing trading, you need to only focus on the large moves and ignore small moves, i.e. your aim is to buy a bar like b40 and hold it till b59 rather than buying the low of b50, b54 and selling at +1 profit each.\n\nTherefore, if you are looking to swing and the price pulls back more than 4t from your entry price, it may not end up being a good swing at all. The next step then is to tune your trading to accurately assess the largest market turns of the day and take only those setups.\n\nOnce you have a fixed stop size, then your scalp size is automatically twice the risk if you want to swing half your contracts. (If you want to take a fixed profit, anything larger than your risk is acceptable). This gives a 5t fixed stop and 10t scalp target for my style of trading. Since most of my entries eventually end up being large moves, on an average I'm always better off swinging at least half.\n\nNaturally, 5t/10t above is determined based on my personal trading history and for my strategy of trying to only trade major swings.

Letting trades go if they dont seem to match the risk to reward expectation is the basic underlying framework of any profitable trading system.\n\nAs long as you try to recognize every tradable patterns and act on them, you are likely to stay a breakeven trader or slightly better. Once you are comfortable letting trades go, you become a far better trader.\n\nThe larger your risk, the higher your chances of making a trade work, but also higher your loss if the setup were to fail. The bare minimum risk on ES is 5t.  If you are just starting out, your win rate is probably near 50%. At 50% a 1 point win such as the long above b11 versus a 5t loss actually works against you. To account for commissions and other costs, you need to take at least 6t just to breakeven.  You would really need to look for trades that give you 2x your risk.\n\nOn an average day, there may be about two to five low risk/high reward trades. Your goal should be to focus on them and not bother with the minor trades.\n\nFor example, today there were only three setups that gave 10t while respecting a 5t stop (marked with dots on chart). Technically, some other bars such as b60 and b20 may have worked but they were second entries or not clear setups.\n\nThe best risk to reward is the first deep pullback in a new move. b17L was the first deep pullback in a bull move and b69S was the first deep pullback in a bear move.\n\nMeasuring risk is also about knowing when you can trade and when you need to sit out. When bars are small (b23-60) you are usually better off sitting out until bars come back to normal. Otherwise, you risk the pattern play out just as you expected but unable to reach your target.

The bare minimum risk on ES is 5t.  If you are just starting out, your win rate is probably near 50%. At 50% a 1 point win such as the long above b11 versus a 5t loss actually works against you. To account for commissions and other costs, you need to take at least 6t just to breakeven.  You would really need to look for trades that give you 2x your risk.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On an average day, there may be about two to five low risk/high reward trades. Your goal should be to focus on them and not bother with the minor trades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, today there were only three setups that gave 10t while respecting a 5t stop (marked with dots on chart). Technically, some other bars such as b60 and b20 may have worked but they were second entries or not clear setups.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The best risk to reward is the first deep pullback in a new move. b17L was the first deep pullback in a bull move and b69S was the first deep pullback in a bear move.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Measuring risk is also about knowing when you can trade and when you need to sit out.

A good signal bar is any signal bar with a shaved or 1t tail on the entry side and at least a 2t body. Ideally, the signal bar is neither too small or too large compared to recent bars.\n\nI always recommend entering on good signal bars for a couple of reasons. When the market is not ready to trend your way, a strong signal bar is unlikely to trigger (b12, b66). This will protect you from many poor trades. A second important feature of good signal bars is that they are likely to respect a fixed stop (5t/6t for ES) for any given instrument.\n\nHowever, on some days, there simply is no good signal bar in the direction of the trend (b10,16,20,38,50,73) but the reverse direction will often give great looking signal bars (b12,27,30,44,53,66,76).\n\nThis is typical of channel type price action. A trader who insists on great signal bars is likely to take very few trades on a channel day – which is not necessarily a bad thing, since channels are very hard to trade for most traders.\n\nOne way around this is to valuate the strengths of a signal by 3 criteria: location, pattern and signal bar. If location and pattern are strong, take a poor signal bar **with-trend**. For our purposes, location is a support such as HLC of prior day, ema, trendline, breakout point (as in BT) etc. Pattern is any two or three legged pullback.\n\nTherefore, take any two or three legged pullback to a support even on a weak bar. This enables us to take b50, b56 long for example.

Some of this is due to being emotionally reactive. A trader who sees a huge bar like b8 may be tempted to sell below it and is likely to be stopped out. Similarly, a trader may short a bull trend all the way to the top and blow up an account.\n\nThe first step is to understand what made you fail. Did you enter on fear of being left out instead of waiting for a setup? Are you deficient in some price action principles? (shorting all the way to the top = does not understand trends can go on indefinitely). Are your stops too tight? Are your targets too lofty? Do you enter too early? Do you love to pick tops and bottoms? Do you enter before a signal bar closes only to find that the good looking bull bar 30 seconds before bar close is now a bear bar? Do you enter on limit banking on your ability to predict reversals to the tick? Do you misread overlaps and chop as patterns?\n\nWhatever your errors may be, you need to first identify them. The next step is to figure out the right way to trade those situations. Ignoring actual reversals and taking the 1st pullback after the successful reversal alone eliminates over half the errors above. Using proper trade management eliminates most of the others. If you can get here, you should be breakeven to slightly profitable on most days. But to get here, you need to practice over and over and only sustained effort can break your bad habits.\n\nDays where price action exposes a large gap in your experience (counter-trend trading on trend days) are likely to still create large losing days and therefore, you should switch to SIM to collect data on these days. Identifying market structure responsible for huge losses and acting on them is a much harder task, but the fact that you switched to SIM after two losing trades enables you to stay in the game and figure out ways to identify and trade such exceptional days.\n\nEven so, there would be rare days such as the flash-crash that could still give you some trouble. But you would be far more confident in your trading and welcome the opportunity to learn from exceptional events.","src/content/blog/2012-09-03-the-hard-road-to-consistency-ix-the-need-to-re-lea.md","f8c5c5dc29ad9339",{"html":6331,"metadata":6332},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2012-08-31_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A trader should be expected to constantly having to learn and re-learn lessons and this is just part of learning to trade.

If the region did not drift, it would simply be BW. Channels are important because unlike BW which can only be scalped for a few ticks or a couple of points, channels do trend and can be traded for enough points to justify the risks of entering a trade. The goal is to trade channels with a fixed size stop such that the potential profit is larger than the risk taken with a high probability of success.\n\nChannels generally have the following characteristics:\n\n**Multi-bar overlap: **It is common for a bar to be overlapped by many following bars. For example, on the day on the right, b7 was overlapped by every bar except b1 and b19 until it finally broke out of the channel.\n\n**Tails:** You are likely to encounter bars with tails on both sides, regardless of color. These tails look like a trend is just about to break when watched mid-bar and then the bar will close with the opposing color, leading to poor mid-bar decisions. Never make mid-bar decisions, especially in a channel.\n\n**Alternating bar colors:** True channels have alternating colored bars with some dojis thrown in. Channels without opposing colored bars are Trend Channels (TC) and are actually simply trends. You can trade with-trend on the close of any small bar in TC but in a true channel you are likely to be stopped out if you use a fixed size stop. True channels that form a leg are leg channels (LC). Sometimes  a channel is so wide that it looks like a sloping trading range. These are trading range channels (TRC).\n\n**Unpredictable behavior:** Channels may reverse (b19), break out (b30), may turn into any other type price action and are generally hard to predict.\n\nThe primary goal of trading channels is to determine the following:\n\n1. Origin: Detect PA turning into a channel and determine direction.\n\n2. Reversal: Channel may reverse direction while remaining a channel.\n\n3. Breakout: Channel breaks into a steep trend move. This is the most important.\n\nWhile even simple detection of a channel is valuable because it enables you to avoid getting chopped up, detecting breakouts and sharp moves intra-channel allow you to maximize your profits if you wish to trade channels.

If you are on the wrong side of the market, your chances of a scalp trade are smaller and chances of a swing trade are nil. A simple way to determine direction is to draw a trendline and trade only when the price tests the trendline. Trendlines should be drawn from the start of the move. Most days, this would be from the LOD or HOD but some days such as today, the beginning of the move could be a different bar such as b24. Experienced traders can also detect a reversal such as the three push reversal at b9 and trade the reversal of a trend. New traders should skip reversals and take the first reasonable pullback after the successful reversal (b24).\n\nProbability of success takes slightly more experience to judge. On most days, after determining the market is in a trend, you can take every two legged pullback such as b44 until the trend breaks (a sustained move beyond the trendline). On hard trend days, you can take any pullback and any small signal bar in the direction of the trend as long as the entry side of the signal bar does not have a large tail.\n\nRoom for profit takes quite a bit of experience to judge. In a normal trend, a pullback can be expected to at least take out the prior extreme by one tick and therefore a deep pullback is likely to give sufficient profit. However in hard trends and large gap opens, even a couple of ticks may give a decent profit. High volatility and clean patterns are friends when it comes to profit targets. Barbwire and tiny bars are terrible enemies and greatly interfere with profit target estimation.\n\nStop size is possibly the hardest to correctly determine. Signal bar stops often work but could be too large from a risk:reward perspective. A fixed stop is easy to use for clear patterns and strong bars but very hard for channels and overlapped bars. For example, despite correctly reading the low of the day today, my stop was short by 1t resulting in a losing trade and missing out on a great swing setup.\n\nTaking a fixed stop and continuously keeping track of market direction using the nine transitions means you only look for probability and profit target when entering a trade. Passing up shallow pullbacks means you only need to focus on probability, which boils down to looking for a clear set of patterns and strong signal bars.\n\nThe fewer parameters involved in your decision making, the more confident you will be in your decisions and help you become a successful trader.","src/content/blog/2012-09-27-components-of-a-successful-trade.md","15c3ca25ff3f24fc",{"html":6403,"metadata":6404},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2012-09-27_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A trader needs to determine 4 important attributes for a successful trade:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Direction\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Probability\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Room for profit\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Stop\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Direction is obvious.

In general, when the signal and entry bars are poor, i.e. overlapped and taily, I watch for channel formation.\n\nSince in normal trends signal and entry bars are clearly not overlapped (b4,5 or b6,7 or b8,9), any heavy overlap of signal and entry bars should put you on guard. In particular if the entry bar and the next two bars overlap the signal bar, you have certainly entered a channel. Therefore on this day, at b20, you have already detected a channel.\n\nDetecting channels is not complete until channel direction is also determined. This is trickier to do in real-time since what looks like a channel down simply completes a structural requirement of say three legs and then changes direction.\n\nA channel direction is canonically determined when you can draw a channel trendline.  The earliest direction estimate comes from two LL and a LH or two HH and a HL. Therefore today you would confirm a downward channel at b24. Sometimes what looks like a channel can quickly turn into a triangle or expanding triangle and trap you if you enter too early.\n\nConflicting channel trendlines (shown above) are common during the nacent phase of the channel. This is a common cause of stop-outs and finding oneself on the wrong side of the market. While the trendline from the start of the move (b13) is usually the best trendline for big picture, channels often test the trendline from channel start (b19).\n\nNever get trapped into thinking that a channel has reversed on the first attempt and trade the newly turned trendline (b33-41). These succeed rarely.\n\nOnce you are in a channel, you need to switch your trading to channel mode. Practices that are poor in normal trading such as fading bars become viable in channels and practices that are good in normal trading such as fixed stops and entering on signal bar breakouts lose their strength in a channel.\n\nYou could simply wait for price action to break out of channel mode and then look for an entry. When a pullback no longer overlaps the signal bar (b47) you can safely take with trend entries without fear of being stopped out (b59 s, b64s).","src/content/blog/2012-10-05-channel-theory-ii-origin.md","4134d8c03ed2cae7",{"html":6421,"metadata":6422},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2012-10-05_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once we have a \u003Ca href=\"http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2012/10/channel-theory-i-defining-channels.html\">definition of a channel\u003C/a>, we can apply that to detect when price action displays signs of turning into a channel.

This is trickier to do in real-time since what looks like a channel down simply completes a structural requirement of say three legs and then changes direction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A channel direction is canonically determined when you can draw a channel trendline.  The earliest direction estimate comes from two LL and a LH or two HH and a HL. Therefore today you would confirm a downward channel at b24. Sometimes what looks like a channel can quickly turn into a triangle or expanding triangle and trap you if you enter too early.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Conflicting channel trendlines (shown above) are common during the nacent phase of the channel. This is a common cause of stop-outs and finding oneself on the wrong side of the market. While the trendline from the start of the move (b13) is usually the best trendline for big picture, channels often test the trendline from channel start (b19).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Never get trapped into thinking that a channel has reversed on the first attempt and trade the newly turned trendline (b33-41). These succeed rarely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once you are in a channel, you need to switch your trading to channel mode. Practices that are poor in normal trading such as fading bars become viable in channels and practices that are good in normal trading such as fixed stops and entering on signal bar breakouts lose their strength in a channel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You could simply wait for price action to break out of channel mode and then look for an entry. When a pullback no longer overlaps the signal bar (b47) you can safely take with trend entries without fear of being stopped out (b59 s, b64s).\u003C/p>",{"headings":6423,"localImagePaths":6424,"remoteImagePaths":6425,"frontmatter":6426,"imagePaths":6428},[],[],[],{"title":6415,"pubDate":6427},["Date","2012-10-05T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2012-10-05-channel-theory-ii-origin.md","2012-10-08-channel-theory-iii-transitions",{"id":6430,"data":6432,"body":6435,"filePath":6436,"digest":6437,"rendered":6438,"legacyId":6447},{"title":6433,"pubDate":6434},"Channel Theory III - Transitions",["Date","2012-10-08T00:00:00.000Z"],"![](/images_upscaled/2012-10-08_5m.png)\n\nOnce we detect price action has [entered a channel](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2012/10/channel-theory-ii-origin.html), we should be able to follow its transitions just like regular price action.

While its true that often channels end up breaking (such as the move from b66-77 today), the fact of the matter is channels last forever because they constantly attempt to reverse and fail.\n\nThe very uncertain nature of channels can trick you into reading all sorts of reversals if you just look at it the right way.

Yes, they were all potential reversals and yet the market made new lows well into the close.\n\nYou have to realize that every reversal signal in a channel is a trap. Traders who are used to trading counter-trend at bottom of trading ranges will find themselves buying all the way into the hole on a day like this.\n\nThe trick to trading a channel such as this is to expect every reversal to fail and take the failure in the direction of the channel.

So if the move down from b77 had given a 2 or 3L HL, you may take it for another leg up. A 1L move should never be taken since it can fail and result in a 2L move very quickly.\n\nIf you missed an entry, you can often enter beyond a small trend bar as long as its not too far from the trendline or ema. For example, b19 and b29, b47, b50 are ok entries.\n\nBut the best way to trade such a channel is to swing a contract from an early entry and hold it till the end of the day or an obvious reversal.","src/content/blog/2012-10-19-channel-theory-vi-channels-are-forever.md","14aa23629c387c26",{"html":6493,"metadata":6494},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2012-10-19_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A channel after a strong spike such as today should be expected to last forever.

A persistent man is likely to solve the problem, get the date with the woman of his choice or get a job. We judge people's conviction in their positions by how well they can defend their own views. A telling example is the characterization of an election candidate as a flip-flopper resulting in their election loss. Holding fast a misinformed opinion is seen as a sign of strong ethos than switching position based on new evidence.\n\nYour conviction or faith in your opinion endears you to your social clique.

When our ancestors were primitive creatures facing an uncertain world, the mind would sense imminent danger and opportunity and activate the physical changes need for immediate action.\n\nObvious examples are when a predator is sensed, the body needs to quickly switch to fight-or-flight mode. Similarly, when food or mating opportunities are sighted, the mind becomes alert and eager.\n\nPractically all your emotions and behavior stem from millions of years of survival adaptation. In the ancient world, reacting to good or bad situations immediately and appropriately meant life instead of death. Modern humans rarely face such challenges and have developed some degree of control over their emotions. Occasionally, the limbic system keeps escalating emotion and may be hard for you to control it.\n\n***Emotions are about expectancy and preparedness***. Events that you are well aware are likely to happen and are prepared for do not cause strong emotional reaction. For example, if someone close to you dies suddenly, you may feel shock and dispair and cry for days. On the other hand, if they were terminally ill for a couple of years, their death may actually bring you closure and relief instead. Similarly, if you do not win the lottery, you don't really go into an emotional fit because you never expected to win. But when you win, you are delighted.\n\nEvents that you are unprepared for can cause your body to go into \"just do something\" mode. For example, countries where there are fire-prevention drills see systematic evacuation on a fire alarm while those without may see stampedes.\n\n***What does this mean to me as a trader?***\n\nWhen you are watching the market, your mind is in a mode similar to the mind looking for mating opportunities. You'll probably hit on every potential trade till one works. Once you are in a trade, you watch anxiously for prey or potential danger. This compels you to exit trades early with no loss than to stand your ground and be stopped out. When you are stopped out, your mind acts like a parent gazelle whose calf has been attacked by wolves.. Your mind goes into \"just do something\" crisis mode. This is also called classic tilt mode, when a couple of losses force the trader to abandon all risk management and trade management rules and just try to get his money back.\n\nLets call these three emotions lust, fear and desperation. Of these desperation is the hardest to control. Your mind is in a state where its willing to go to great lengths and take severe risks to get back its precious young. You will do the most damage to your account in this state. Fear prevents you from following through with your trading plan and you will end up with small winners and large losers and you will be a net loser over the long term. Lust traps you into poor trade after poor trade and your account will bleed slowly from a thousand cuts.\n\n***So how do I address this in my trading plan?***\n\nOnce you understand the forces driving you, you can work on managing them. One way to manage this is to try to observe yourself and see how you act. The very act of observation will change the observed (the observer effect).\n\n**Desperation:** When you are in desperation, you are unlikely to be able to observe yourself and think rationally. Having someone else observe you will often help with a reality check. This could be a mentor or trading buddy. Its important you disclose all your trades to your observer or it wont have the full effect. Your trading buddy can watch out for signs of poor emotional state and support you with feedback. Having a maximum trade count per day and a maximum loss limit will greatly protect your account from an untimely demise.\n\n**Fear: **More important than entering a trade is what you do after you enter. If the trade was ill-advised and caused by chasing an unexpected large bar, you should probably just exit at the best possible price. If the trade was a legitimate setup, you need to follow your trade management with discipline. Only discipline will help you overcome fear and develop confidence. Making trade management a mechanical affair with fixed stops and targets frees your mind of fear.\n\n**Lust:** Before you enter a trade and before you have encountered a losing trade for the day, your mind is best prepared to make clear judgements. If you can read the market reasonably well, take every clear setup until you hit your daily loss limit. When starting out, your read of the market will naturally need a lot of improvement and losses are routine. What you do not want to do is to react to unexpected moves. Any trade you took on an expected move is far more likely to be successful than a trade taken on unexpected moves. Tame your desire to be part of the action. Only take well defined setups. Start with one setup and add more with time.\n\nNaturally, these are not the only emotions you face. Greed, which makes you hold well beyond your expected target is another great killer. Hope, which persuades you to loosen your stops prevents you from developing any kind of discipline. All of these need to be understood and addressed.\n\nIn summary, realize that your emotions are telling you that an event occurred that you did not expect and were unprepared for. Learn from the event and incorporate it into your trading plan rather than reacting to it immediately by trading. Use understanding, preparation and discipline to tame your emotions.","src/content/blog/2012-11-15-the-traders-mind-viii-the-basics-of-emotions.md","7e5d52db7b9dcfe6",{"html":6655,"metadata":6656},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>What exactly are emotions and why do we feel them?\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Emotions are a form of self-communication.

When traders say that overtrading is a very common trading error, thats only half-correct. Many of the ills of trading poorly show up as overtrading. By limiting the number of trades you can make, you prevent the amount of damage you can do to your account in one sitting. But more important, your mind needs to shift from getting into ***this move*** to getting into the*** biggest move*** of the day. Since there are only one or two big moves in the first couple of hours and perhaps another in the last hour and half, your approach switches to looking for quality trades and large swing trades.\n\nWhat this means for your account is that despite a low win rate, you can still be a profitable trader if your wins are at least twice as large as your losses. Your goal as a new trader should be to exclusively focus on large moves. If you are unsure the move is going to be large, its ok not to take the trade. Don't worry if you stand aside and the move ends up being big. That is part of trading. Learn to let it go. Similarly, you will be stopped out a couple of times and the very next move will be large (or not). That's ok. You are in the process of learning to judge exactly where the large move is. With experience it will come naturally (but not without sufficient screen time).\n\n***Replace fear with discipline***\n\nOnce your discrimination and judgement get better, your larger wins and smaller losses will make you a better selector of trades however, your trade management needs to be extremely disciplined. Note that as long as you are trading in a trend (HH and HL or LL and LH) with volatility (decent size swings and bars) and near support (TL/ema/swingpoint), your chances of success should be slightly greater than 50% at the very least. Add good pattern and signal bar and your win rate should be around 60% or even more. Your decision to enter the trade is all the processing your mind needs to make. Once you set a stop and target, do not change them. Your mind is vulnerable when in a trade and susceptible to errors of judgement. You should simply let the math work for you and let the market either fill your target or take your stop out. If your setups are truly 60%, you will accumulate winnings in the long run.\n\n***Replace desperation with acceptance***\n\nMany professionally successful people who come to trading believe rightly that perseverance is a virtue and its their dogged persistence that made them successful. Realize that in trading, perseverance is inapplicable and desperation is probably what you will slip into. Learn to accept that today is a losing day and stop trading. Take a trading buddy's help if you wish. Disclose your losing trades and let them tell you to stop. Soon, you will be able to stop on your own. Similarly, do not be overconfident on successive wins and end up taking untested setups. Many traders have their large losing days right after their large winning days. If you are susceptible to these, just take a day off or only take one trade the next day after a big winning or losing day, win or lose.\n\n***Refine your method continuously***\n\nOver time, you can make slight changes to the above rules and fine tune your setups. For example, you should always keep track of the success rate of your individual setups and your average win or loss per setup. That way, passing a lower expectancy setup or taking a good setup with a questionable signal bar become easier. Always keep your trading goals in mind when you refine your methods. For example, you should prefer to refine your system for higher probability than to get a better price since adding a contract to a higher probability trade is a better way to make more money than getting an extra couple of ticks on existing size.\n\nOver time, your approach and mental state will shift to that of a successful trader. However, this is not easy and will be a constant struggle. Even after you have been winning for a while, its possible to have slip ups and lapse into your old habits. You should always be on guard and protect your mind from harmful habits as long as you are a trader.","src/content/blog/2012-11-18-the-traders-mind-x-the-transition-to-success.md","ee69371252fa5059",{"html":6691,"metadata":6692},"\u003Cp>So now that you understand the differences in psychological makeup of a \u003Ca href=\"http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-traders-mind-viii-basics-of-emotions.html\">new trader\u003C/a> versus a \u003Ca href=\"http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-traders-mind-ix-consistent-trader.html\">successful trader\u003C/a>, let’s see how to transition your mind from the former to the latter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>Replace lust with caution and skepticism\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The very first step is to limit the number of trades you take.

Nearly all of them have failed to generate consistent profit (although many did work for a few months). Some of this may be simply because the systems were not suited to my style of thinking but I believe most systems are biased towards a perma-bull market and will fail during any sharp bear move. And most such failures are spectacular.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is that newcomers are attracted to trading when they hear success stories from their friends and family. Such success stories, especially dramatic trades usually occur near the top of a bull market. Systems that have recently proven to be working in the past year or two are likely to be biased towards a bull market. This attracts newcomers right before an impending crash.\n\nSystems that cannot work in both bull and bear markets are terrible choices for a trader. The best and largest moves occur in bear markets but bull markets last longer. Any system that cannot trade both is likely to be a poor performer unless you happen to start your trading career in a lucky decade.\n\nAfter trying out indicators, buy and hold and all manner of fundamental trading, I finally settled on price action trading as a framework for my system. Price action fit well into my understanding of demand and supply and my observation that one cannot consistently predict at what price the market is likely to turn. Trends can be dramatic and sharp and last much longer than anyone can predict.\n\nOne of my early discoveries was that anything you may know about any system is probably incomplete. There will always be subtleties that you need to pay and learn over time. There will always be edge cases where a certain setup may not be valid and even after you have detailed experience trading a single setup, a good percentage of the time, the setup will simply fail to reach target before taking out your stop.\n\nAnother observation is that some setups are likely to give a large gain if they are successful. For example, the 1st pullback after a trend breakout early in the day is likely to give a large move lasting for at least an hour. Even if the setup here is weak, its often worth taking the risk of a small loss since the win will usually be very large and more than make up for a few losing trades.\n\nThere is simply no way around the fact that trading is a system of probabilities and you need to find and press your edge. When the winning probability of a setup is high, you can take the trade even when the expected gain is smaller.\n\nPrice action trading provides a general framework where I experiment, learn and build my trading system. Unlike a system that uses indicators which really has no framework but simply magic math that tries to convert a price movement into a binary buy/sell decision, a price action framework can keep you on the right side of the market, enable you to anticipate large moves or chop and act accordingly.\n\nThis general framework is a springboard from which you can refine your trading and market reading skills on your journey to be a profitable trader.","src/content/blog/2012-12-09-creating-a-trading-system-iii-price-action-trading.md","7205bbc671e7d053",{"html":6763,"metadata":6764},"\u003Cp>Over the years I have tried nearly every system of trading.

Any system that cannot trade both is likely to be a poor performer unless you happen to start your trading career in a lucky decade.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After trying out indicators, buy and hold and all manner of fundamental trading, I finally settled on price action trading as a framework for my system. Price action fit well into my understanding of demand and supply and my observation that one cannot consistently predict at what price the market is likely to turn. Trends can be dramatic and sharp and last much longer than anyone can predict.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of my early discoveries was that anything you may know about any system is probably incomplete. There will always be subtleties that you need to pay and learn over time. There will always be edge cases where a certain setup may not be valid and even after you have detailed experience trading a single setup, a good percentage of the time, the setup will simply fail to reach target before taking out your stop.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another observation is that some setups are likely to give a large gain if they are successful. For example, the 1st pullback after a trend breakout early in the day is likely to give a large move lasting for at least an hour. Even if the setup here is weak, its often worth taking the risk of a small loss since the win will usually be very large and more than make up for a few losing trades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is simply no way around the fact that trading is a system of probabilities and you need to find and press your edge. When the winning probability of a setup is high, you can take the trade even when the expected gain is smaller.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Price action trading provides a general framework where I experiment, learn and build my trading system. Unlike a system that uses indicators which really has no framework but simply magic math that tries to convert a price movement into a binary buy/sell decision, a price action framework can keep you on the right side of the market, enable you to anticipate large moves or chop and act accordingly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This general framework is a springboard from which you can refine your trading and market reading skills on your journey to be a profitable trader.\u003C/p>",{"headings":6765,"localImagePaths":6766,"remoteImagePaths":6767,"frontmatter":6768,"imagePaths":6770},[],[],[],{"title":6757,"pubDate":6769},["Date","2012-12-09T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2012-12-09-creating-a-trading-system-iii-price-action-trading.md","2013-01-07-creating-a-trading-system-v-a-mathematical-model",{"id":6772,"data":6774,"body":6777,"filePath":6778,"digest":6779,"rendered":6780,"legacyId":6789},{"title":6775,"pubDate":6776},"Creating a trading system V - A mathematical model",["Date","2013-01-07T00:00:00.000Z"],"[**![](/images_upscaled/2013-01-07_5m.png)](/images_upscaled/2013-01-07_5m.png)\n\nRandom walk theory considers all of market action as random movement, bereft of any tradable patterns.

You never know how far exactly the price will move before the overlap pulls back.\n\nLets survey the trades we took today and their results:\n\nTrade 1: b4 is a bull bar in a down move and an overlap. Sell its close (loss -11t due to 1t slippage)\n\nTrade 2: Sell the high of b1 since a move above it would overlap a range. (-10t)\n\nTrade 3: Sell the high of the bar (b7) that overlapped the range (+20t)\n\nTrade 4: Sell the close of b15 since it overlapped a range (and few bars) (+15t)\n\nTrade 5: Buy the low of b15, the OL (-10t)\n\nTrade 6: Sell the high of b20, a counter-trend OL (+13t)\n\nAlthough we did end the day up, its simply because our wins were larger than our stop. If our targets were smaller than our stops, this would be a negative day. The first lesson is determining stops and targets is that your target should always be larger than your stop for you to be profitable even with a modest win rate.\n\nThe second lesson we learn is that a trend can breakout and foil your fades. A trend development may be subtle enough that you dont notice it. Note that at trade 5, there was no obvious trend down, and once a trend sets in, only with-trend trades are likely to succeed.\n\nThe most important point about fading overlaps is that you need to be an extremely highly skilled trader to consistently extract value from the market. This is because unlike a bar scalp, your expected profit is smaller and your win rate is lower.\n\nIn hindsight, it would seem obvious that you could easily fade every bar from b47 to b55 but in real time, there is no way of telling how long the overlapping pattern would last.

If a trader is able to take trades that eventually move in the direction of your trade, then they could theoretically be profitable with larger stops. A simple way to do this is to not bet on any reversal attempts. Instead let the reversal attempt actually succeed (take out a swing point) and then take the next pullback. With-trend entries enable directional correctness. The market needs to be trending  (higher highs/lows or lower lows/highs) and not in a chop.

A test of the trendline or ema or HLC of the prior day are usually good choices for entry. A good location ensures that many more traders enter with you increasing the probability of success.  Two or three legged pullbacks have higher probability than a one legged pullback. The earlier the pullback, the weaker it can be, i.e., the first pullback can be one-legged with a poor bar if its deep. The second and subsequent pullbacks should be two legs and deep and should preferably have a good signal bar. Do not be tempted by one-legged shallow pullbacks after the first pullback. They are likely to fail and give a two-legged deep pullback. If you find that you are often stopped out and the price eventually moves in your direction, you need to develop patience and let the market develop better entries. Once you have mastered this for normal trends, you can make adjustment for hard and soft-trends. You would still need to be cautious after an extended move or third pushes since a retrace would need to be two or three legs.\n\nA good way to distill the points above is to reduce them to **location, pattern and bar**. A good location is a pullback to a support in a trend move. A good pattern is a deep pullback, preferably two or three legged. A good bar is a strong close, non-overlapped signal bar (with adjustments for 2BR, oio, etc., where you would treat the entire pattern as one bar).\n\n**Estimating targets: **Once you have mastered directional correctness and are generally successful taking the right entries, you can work on maximizing your profits. The most obvious choices are measured moves of a trading range and overshoot of TCL on third push. You should also look to exit near the recent extreme once a trend is broken.\n\nRemember the order of mastery and take them up one by one. Until you have mastered directional correctness, your mind does not have the bandwidth to absorb the intricacies of the right pattern and entry. Until you can confidently take the right entry without fear of being stopped out, you will have no conviction to hold until your estimated target.\n\nOnce you have all the three, you have developed a framework into which other observations of the market fall naturally into place.

They suspect a potentially large drop or huge rally that will net hundreds of ticks which they have been waiting for all their lives and are compelled to act.

Such a test needs to be simple enough that you can evaluate it in a moment and anticipate such a setup as it develops. If you have to process a lot of information at the second a bar closes, the urgency will force you into errors.\n\nA simple three pronged test I use is the following: The trade should occur with support.

You should not be worried about taking a loss or panicking if the trade moves against you. Some amount of losing trades are normal and you should welcome them.\n\nOnce you enter, hold your ground and do not exit early.

In fact, you should sell the farm, borrow money and bet it all on the 100% certain bet. On the other hand if you have a 0% certainty that the same outcome would occur, you would do the same, except bet the opposite way, i.e., that the said outcome wouldn't occur.\n\nFrom these extremes, it should be obvious that the hardest bet is when the probability is exactly 50%. Its effectively a coin-toss and if you repeat it long enough, you should break even. However, you could have long stretches of wins and losses and therefore you would need to bet smaller amounts. In fact, the right thing to do here is to bet the smallest possible size since your net outcome is the same regardless of the size of the bet but the damage to your account is smaller if you bet the absolute minimum. This makes the bet curve shaped like the letter U with max bets at 0% probability, falling sharply to near zero at 50% and rising sharply at 100% probability.\n\nPlacing trades is similar to the above scenario with certain differences. First of all, you can actually sit out and not bet in the mid-probability, which is most of the time in the market. Secondly, there is a transaction cost for every bet and therefore a you are likely to go underwater rapidly if you trade anywhere except a high probability zone simply from the costs. The new shape is like a strike-through letter U. Lastly, to bet something would not happen you would need to do something other than what we do here, such as write options.\n\nSince costs are a significant amount in a high transaction account, simply sitting out low probability trades can push you from a losing account into a winning account.\n\nWhen you are not certain whether a trade is high or low probability, it makes sense to trade a smaller size. For example, on this day, I placed full sized trades for #1 and #5 which earned handsome profits and smaller sizes of #2,#3 and #4, which effectively were a wash.","src/content/blog/2013-08-27-sizing.md","e9fcbbb9ab66bd2e",{"html":7307,"metadata":7308},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2013-08-27_5m.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images_upscaled/2013-08-27_results.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A common risk reduction technique is to minimize size on less desirable odds and increase size on desirable odds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For instance, if you had nearly 100% certainty that a certain outcome would occur, it makes sense to bet everything you have on it.

First of all, you can actually sit out and not bet in the mid-probability, which is most of the time in the market. Secondly, there is a transaction cost for every bet and therefore a you are likely to go underwater rapidly if you trade anywhere except a high probability zone simply from the costs. The new shape is like a strike-through letter U. Lastly, to bet something would not happen you would need to do something other than what we do here, such as write options.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since costs are a significant amount in a high transaction account, simply sitting out low probability trades can push you from a losing account into a winning account.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you are not certain whether a trade is high or low probability, it makes sense to trade a smaller size.

This is called the VIMM model. The more visual elements on the screen, the harder your brain needs to work just to recognize patterns.

Removing the ema and volume bars has direct effect of freeing up visual work.\n\nOnce your vision has processed symbols, your intellect works on recognizing patterns and performing analysis. Your memory enters the picture next, recalling every piece of data relevant to the situation at hand.

Under stress, people are unable to process information efficiently and this often results in making mistakes that are obvious in hindsight.\n\nMy approach to this problem is to have very few setups. The real factors in trading are time of day, volatility and money management. Setups are important, but secondary. As you can see today, one or two hours on the open is the best time to trade. The rest of the day is often lukewarm. Today is also a poor day to trade because there is no real volatility. On a big day, you can simply enter with trend and ride it out. The 5t stop is the money management and trade management piece. Despite a win rate of only 20%, my Profit Factor for the day is 1.78, which is decent.

Trending markets for example, facilitate with trend trades and usually cause reversal setups to fail with high probability. Trading ranges on the other hand, facilitate fading breakouts with high probability.\n\nI divide the market price action into the following categories:\n\n**Trend (or [elastic trend](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/search?q=elastic)):** There is an obvious trending in the market. Bars in the direction of the trend are small, close strong and there are multiple bars in any given trend-side push. Bars against the trend are fewer, usually larger and if there is more than a single bar, closes are usually weaker.\n\n**[Hard Trend](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2011/01/trading-hard-trends.html):** This is a kind of trend where there are very few bars in the counter-trend direction. With-trend bars can be large or small, pullbacks are usually just a bar or two. This is a very strong trend.\n\n**[Soft-trend](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/2011/03/correctly-trading-soft-trend.html):** Bars are very small both trend-side and counter-trend-side. Very shallow pullbacks and pushes.\n\n**[Channels](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/search?q=channel+theory):** Channels look like Soft-trends but with one big difference. Unlike the trends above, a pullback in a channel often overlaps into the previous signal bar.\n\n**[Trading Range](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/search?q=trading+range):** There is no discernible trend. Erratic movements usually lasting two or three pushes in one direction followed by pushes in the opposing direction. A move in one direction may or may not reach the other side before reversing, therefore hard to gauge profit target.\n\n**[Barb Wire](http://ninetrans.blogspot.com/search?q=barb+wire):** A special kind of Trading range where the price action is confined to a narrow range made of small bars, many of which are dojis\n\n**The Open:** Markets that have \"Regular Trading Hours\" have opens and closes for the day and the open of a given day has often behavior that may look entirely unlike the previous day. When the market opens and the first bar begins to form, the market is not in any of the above states yet and is considered to be in the open state. This lasts for about 10 bars or so.\n\n**The Setups**\n\nEach price action type has its own list of setups. A setup that works very well for hard-trend will fail for a channel and vice-versa. These 30 setups cover every possible large move from any type of price action. If you master these, you can trade any market.\n\nThere is a small number of setups per price action type and you can focus on a much smaller set of patterns. Setups marked beta are sustained observations but I'm unsure if they can be traded profitably in all kinds of markets.

The initial move off the open often turns into a W like move (b1-b13)  and results in a potential trend move that usually takes out the other end of the W (low of b1). If the breakout is strong, the move may continue to another measure of the W (distance from b1 L to b14 H).\n\nOften W setups are not clean (b14).
