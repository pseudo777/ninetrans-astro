When the market has only one bull bar in the first couple of hours and not a single close above the ema, its an indication of a very strong trend. Extremely strong trends produce multiple A2 entries but it gets harder and harder psychologically to sell after a strong move down. Holding an early entry is easy, especially when there are no bars against your position. Once you have a possible trend break (b18-25), there's always a chance of imminent reversal so it gets harder to leave a huge open profit which could evaporate in the event of a sudden rally.

Some days such as today, strong trends run till the end of the day and on other days like yesterday, they can reverse completely, so a simple strategy is to move the stop just behind every new swing point.

A psychologically seasoned trader however can hold a swing position in a strong trend until one of the following occurs:

- Strong TCL overshoot of 4t or more
- 2nd TCL overshoot of 2t or more.
- Trendline break and successful test of extreme (i.e., price does not break much below extreme)
- failed A2 (A2 triggers, approaches extreme, reverses and takes out signal bar)
- One legged close beyond ema
- Breakout bar taking out the ema by many ticks and one or more prior swing points
- TTR (bars suddenly become tiny and swings are only a few ticks from prior swings)
- Double top or double bottom followed by TL break.
- Major Measured moves met.

Of the above, measured moves are only reliable in very strong trends. Thin area measured moves and fH1 measured moves are the most reliable. Double bottoms require being in a trading range since within trends they are simply pullbacks.
