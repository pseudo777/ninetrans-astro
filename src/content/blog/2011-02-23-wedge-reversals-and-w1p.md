The reason I take W1P almost every time and Wedges only when the signal bars are very well formed is simply that I have a lot more information about the strength and sustainability of the reversal. Today's entry forms the blue bottom left and top right corners of the [nine transitions](http://cadavertrading.blogspot.com/2011/01/four-trades-off-nine-transitions.html).

For example, b9 could have been a possible W (since there was no gap between yesterdays last bar and today's open bar, we can treat it like a continuation). However, by the time the possible W1P presented itself at b16, we already had many clues that this reversal attempt would fail:

- the signal bar was weak since it was smaller in size compared to recent bars and had a 2t tail on top.
- A shaved entry bar or an entry bar with only 1t on at least one side strengthens the W. b10 had 2t on both sides.
- A well formed W1P should not tick more than 1t below the entry bar b10. Price closed below it on a strong trend move.

This kind of W1P usually gives a scalp but is not advisable for a swing move. Another similar W occurred at b35. This was weak for several reasons.

- the down/up reversal at b34,35 is a possible trading range and there may be sellers above it. Its best entered on a second entry or after a 2 legged pullback (2L W1P).
- Entry bar was small compared to recent bars
- It closed several ticks below entry bar

The W at b46 however was very much the sign of extreme behavior and even though it wasn't bull bodied, it had a strong entry bar. 
A down/up bar must be of comparable size and should not give an entry far beyond both bars to be an up/down or down/up signal. So b29,21 for example was a good up/down signal but b47 is an entry bar. The pullback bar b49 or the inside bar b51 could be bought as a W1P.
W1Ps tend to move till their move is terminated into another W or until the first pullback in the move down to the W. So for example if the W began at b3, then you could expect W1P to move till b13 high. Sometimes they end in a W as we did today at b71.
