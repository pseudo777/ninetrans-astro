One of the most challenging tasks for any trader including experienced traders is to hold through what looks like chop and take their trade all the way to a swing. Sometimes this is easier when the pullback and congestion is far away from your entry price or you are already in a trend and the price moves away from you favorably right away.

When a trend terminates, determining which entry will lead to a large move is called "The breakout problem" and is a considerably difficult task. To do this, you need to be able to first determine when the trend has actually terminated.

A failed reversal followed by a failed A2 (b54,55 and b61,62) is a classic sign of trend termination. Waiting for a trend to terminate before taking a trade saves you from two non-swing entries (b58 and b64).

Once the trend is terminated, you need to evaluate the chances of a reversal. On a trading range day with bull strength displayed earlier in the day (b6-22) and recently (b55-61). The chances of a move to the other end of the range are decently high. On a strong bear trend day, this would be a lower probability trade.
