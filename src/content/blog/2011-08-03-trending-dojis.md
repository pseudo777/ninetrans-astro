Trending dojis (b35-41, b61-66) are mini-trends. They are small trend moves on a smaller timeframe and a large trend bar on a larger timeframe. When you see trending dojis, the right thing to do is enter with the trend on a pullback bar.

Obviously, most traders did exactly that since the low of b43 and b68 were bought without hesitation for an excellent run each. If you are queasy about buying the close of a bear trend bar on limit, its perfectly fine to wait and see of the next bar is bullish and buy its close or above its high if its not too large.
