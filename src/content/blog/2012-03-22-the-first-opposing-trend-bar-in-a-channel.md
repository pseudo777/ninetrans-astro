![](/images_upscaled/2012-03-22_5m.png)A channel provides few entries and can drag for many points. One of the most reliable entries in a channel is to fade the first opposing trend bar (b15, b27, b60). You can usually sell the close on limit with a tight stop say 2 or 3t. This works particularly well if there were no opposing bars since channel inception.

The reason it works is because this is essentially a first channel breakout that you expect to fail. Note that you need a trend bar with a strong close. A doji such as b57 or a weak close such as b11 is usually not reliable. Often this is just an optimization since you get a signal right after (b16, b30, b61) and you can simply choose to trade it with a normal stop entry.
