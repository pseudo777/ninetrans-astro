If you could only trade one trade a day, the first two legged pullback is the best candidate. You should take out at least 1 contract at +1 and let the rest run. Usually, if the day is going to be a trend day, this is your best chance at leaving a stop at breakeven and getting most of the move. If your breakeven stop is hit, there is a good chance this would not be a big trend day.

A second option is to move the stop after every new high or low. So for example, after b34, you could  move your stop above b28, then move it above b37 when b38 makes a new low and so on. If you took some more off at a larger target, say +4, you could then move the stop only after 2 legged moves, so say above b56 after b64 made a new low.

On days that do not have a two legged pullback, well you dont need to trade since its possibly a hard trend day or a trading range day, which are not amenable to swinging.
