When the price attempts to break out of a clear trading range (b1-17), there are a couple of things that will help us to determine if we should look for fBO trades or BP trades.

Strength in the breakout is likely to result in a BP. Weak BO attempts are likely to result in fBO.

Signs of strength are:

- BO bar is shaved (either end, especially breakout end) (b7, b38)
- BO bar has at least half the bar beyond the breakout point (b7)
- The breakout attempt is a one-legged attempt (b5-b7, b35-b38)
- Second attempt to BO (b38 after b15)

In addition an A2 (b54) is also likely to result in a breakout.
