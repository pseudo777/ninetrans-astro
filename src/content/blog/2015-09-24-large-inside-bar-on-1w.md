Inside bars are tricky and often require judgement to trade correctly. In general, large inside bars are overlaps and therefore a mini trading range. It is generally best to wait for the trade to trigger and take a pullback.

An outside bar that traps traders who did not see the reversal and entered (b23) makes an excellent signal bar if its not too large. If it does not trigger any small trend bar after it (b24) should work.
