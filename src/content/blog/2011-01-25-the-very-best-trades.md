There were probably hundreds of trades today but today was a great sampler of my favorite trades. The first pullback (1PB), Two legged pullback near ema (A2), Double Top or Bottom and pullback (DP), first pullback after Wedge reversal (W1P). The biggest moves come from these trades, and I make sure I enter them when I can read them on time. Today I missed the DP on b54 and possibly the A2 or 1PB on b18.

Trading only these four will still keep you in the black even with a 50% success rate since they often go to +4 points.
