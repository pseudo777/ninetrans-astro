Trading ranges can break into trends from a BP but sometimes they break into higher trading ranges. Usually, there is one break back into a prior trading range during the day. Trending trading ranges are traded exactly like trading ranges. Once your get a breakout pullback, if the trend terminates for any reason (today, TTR b16 to b25) you should look for new breakouts or fBO trades.

Today, we got a breakout pullback back into the lower range at b58. A break into a prior range usually tests the other end of the range (b5 low). If you miss the initial BP or chose not to take it due to the BW price action, you could enter below the bo bar b63 as long as the bar is not too long (say under 2 points).

There were very few reliable trades today. The price action after the early move was poor consisting of 2 and 3 tick dojis and its usually a good idea not to trade them and simply wait for a breakout and then choose to enter a high probability trade.
