On a good day about 1000 people visit this site but only 10 have ever donated. I am not interested in large donations, but I am interested in a large number of donors. Even small amounts like $5 is sufficient to convey that you value the information I provide.

If the situation does not change, I am considering working on this site less frequently and divert my time to other projects.
