A wedge that moves well beyond the TCL but on reasonably sized bars is usually a very strong Wedge, especially if they end in a reversal bar. Such wedges may be hard to read since the test of the high after a strong move up is usually the rule and not the exception. A stronger entry bar at b21 would have perhaps made it easier to read this wedge reversal.

A normal wedge can be expected to retrace the move from the first pullback, i.e, b5 low today. This explains the buying activity from b45 to b56. However, the reversal of the wedge failed and the price moved below b45. This is indicates a very strong down move and usually a measured move to the top of the wedge.
